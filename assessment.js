Please write an explanation for an introduction to sorting algorithms.

/* 
Sorting Algorithm is a way to reorganise large number of items in specific order.
It takes input data as lists and then performs specific operations on it and outputs an ordered array or list.
/*Bubble sort example HERE*/

  // length of the array
  let n = arr.length;

  //iterate n times over the array
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    //visit each pair of elements in the array
    for (let j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
      //if they are out of order, susch as checking present item is greater than next item
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
        // If true then make the swap
        let tmp = arr[j];
        arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
        arr[j + 1] = tmp;

/* Problem 8 */
/*Skill: React
Explain state management and lifting state in React. Please include the difference between Redux and Context API. Your audience is a beginner learner with an understanding of React components, props and basic state. 
//Your explanation HERE

State management in React is a way to share and communicate between components of your application. 
In simple words, state is just a JavaScript object which changes according to the actions of the user.
 React follows top-down approach when communicating between components meaning the lower components are informed about state changes by the upper components. 
 Sometimes when state is needed to be changed between different components, state is lifted to a common ancestor so that all the components that need the state can share it. 
 Redux is a state management library used to manage state in applications not necessarily React but mostly used with React. On the other hand Context API was introduced in React at a much later stage to manage state internally. 
 The key difference between the two is Redux contains a centralized store which all the components in the application can share whenever needed whereas the Context API stores at the top component which the lower level components can share.

How would you explain what Node and Express do to a beginner learner with no experience in server side programming?

Your explanation HERE (2 paragraphs)

Node.js is a backend javascsript cross platform runtime environment which helps in executing and implementing changes to javsacript code outside the browser in the server side

Express.js is a server framework of node.js to build web applications, APIs.
Consists of various features such as middlewares, routers and rendering.
